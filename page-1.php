                    How to Solve a Simple Linear Equation

                      <li>
                        The goal is to isolate &ldquo;x&rdquo; or some variable onto
                        one side of the equation.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When working backwards to find &ldquo;x&rdquo; or some
                        variable, we would need to use the opposite operator to cancel
                        numbers from both sides of the equation. The opposite of
                        addition is substraction and the opposite of multiplication is
                        division.

                      <li>
                        The order of operations or PEMDAS, for short, are a set of
                        rules in which certain math procedures need to be performed
                        first. From the highest priority, it is parenthesis,
                        exponents, multiplication or division, and addition or
                        substraction. When working backwards to find &ldquo;x&rdquo;
                        or some variable, you will also need to flip the way you
                        normally would do your order of operations.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Once you work your way and isolated &ldquo;x&rdquo; or some
                        variable, then you have finished the problem.

                        \(8x + 8 = 48\) is a fairly simple algebraic linear equation
                        you will ever come across. As you can see here to solve our
                        \(x\) we will need to isolate it. In the directions stated
                        above, we would need to do a reverse PEMDAS. First to get rid
                        of the &ldquo;+ 8&rdquo;, we can remove it by subtracting 8
                        from both sides since subtraction is the opposite of addition.
                        Once we subtract 8 from both sides, notice how we have another
                        8 multiplying to our \(x\). Since we need to solve by
                        isolating x, we would need to divide 8 from both sides since
                        division is the opposite of multiplication. Once you have done
                        so, you are left with your answer.

                          As you can see here, we are dealing with harder problems
                          now. Don't be alarm, fractions are not as bad as one would
                          think. Because we're working backwards to find \(y\), we are
                          going to use the reversed PEMDAS to solve for it. Whenever
                          you are dealing with fractions such as the one above, it is
                          best to get rid of the denominator. Since we know that
                          multiplication is the opposite of division, we can multiple
                          both the left-hand and right-hand side by the LCD or least
                          common denominator. When we multiply both sides of the
                          fraction by the LCD a.k.a 15, no matter what happens, we
                          would always get a whole number as you can see on the
                          \(4^{th}\) line. Since we got rid of the denominator and we
                          are left with whole numbers, the equation is much easier to
                          solve. From there we can easily add 5 to both sides, then
                          divide both sides by 6; thus; solving for y.

                          This equation may seem easier than example two, but there's
                          a catch. According to the instructions, it wants you to
                          check the solution. It is always in your best practice to
                          check the solution by plugging your answer back into the
                          variable. Solutions that you have solved correctly, but do
                          not fit into the logic are called
                          <strong>extraneous solutions</strong>. However, there are
                          times when you are solving an equation that does not have a
                          solution. In example three, we found out \(20 = 0\). The
                          problem to that logic is \(20 \ne 0\) and it never will.
                          Therefore, there <strong>DOES NOT</strong> exist a solution
                          for x in this linear equation.
