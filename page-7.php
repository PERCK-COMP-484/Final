                      By using the Distributive Law Part 1, we can distribute \(-a^2\)
                      into each of the variables in the factor. From there, we can use
                      the product rule from Lesson Six to combine liked-terms and add
                      the exponents to their respective bases. Once finished, you have
                      your answer.

                      By the product of two binomials, we can distribute and multiply
                      one factor to another factor. This is also known as FOIL. FOIL
                      stands for FIRST, OUTER, INNER, LAST. As you can see in the
                      formula, you can easily follow along with how FOIL works.
                      Alternatively, you can memorize the formula for the Product of
                      Two Binomials to distribute the first factor into the second
                      factor. After distributing the factors, like from the last
                      lesson and problem, just combined like-terms using the product
                      rule.

                      (x-6)(x+6)<br />
                      let \(a = x\) and let \(b = 6\)<br />
                      \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\)<br />
                      \(x^2 - 6^2\)<br />
                      \(x^2 - 36\)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There are two ways to do this problem. You can use the product
                      of binomials to multiply the two factors, but you have to
                      account for the negatives in the respective variables.
                      Alternatively, I recommend using the product of sum and
                      difference formula since it is the simplest way of multiplying
                      the two factors without showing all the work. You just have to
                      identify what your a and b is and just plug it into the formula
                      as shown in the work above. That way, you can mitigate the
                      workload and save yourself some time.
